# decentralized_voting_system

Problem Statement-A decentralized voting system where a user can walk into a government authorized center (Ex- banks, telecom companies etc.) and cast their vote using the proposed portal.
Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting has Long Queues during elections​

Problem-Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.​

Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.​

you may never know that did your vote reach to person for whom you voted or was diverted into another candidate’s account?​
Since there’s no tracing back of your vote.​
if system is integrated with blockchain- a special property called immutability protects system​

Consider SQL, PHP, or any other traditional database systems. You can insert, update, or delete votes. But in a blockchain you can just insert data but cannot update or delete. Hence when you insert something, it stays there forever and no one can manipulate it- Thus name immutable ledger.​

Solution- Need blockchain database
benefits-No VoterID required as a user's validity (age: 18+) is determined dynamically using the Aadhaar API​

Secure vote by Azure blockchain and biometric authentication (using pre-existing Aadhaar database)​

Reduced cost during election process​

Shorter wait times as it is decentralized​

A vote can be cast from anywhere in the country​

Highly scalable design, immutable and transparent​.

Personal data, and sensitive data in general, should not be trusted in the hands of third-parties, where they are susceptible to attacks and misuse. Instead, users should own and control their data without compromising security or limiting companies’ and authorities’ ability to provide personalized services. Our platform enables this by combining a blockchain, re-purposed as an access-control moderator, with an off-blockchain storage solution. ​
